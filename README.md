Implementation of linear regression , binary Classification and multiClass Classification and i also implemented the Image Classification
Linear Classification:

Implemented to predict outcomes based on a linear decision boundary.

Suitable for problems where the data is linearly separable.

Binary Classification:

Differentiates between two classes using logistic regression or a similar approach.

Common applications include spam detection and sentiment analysis.

Multiclass Classification:

Extends binary classification to handle multiple classes (e.g., classifying crops or predicting weather conditions).

Utilizes softmax or one-vs-all strategies for prediction.

Image Classification:

Uses TensorFlow.js for client-side image processing and classification.

Employs pre-trained models for feature extraction and custom training for specific use cases.

Supports image upload, preview, and prediction, making it intuitive for users.
